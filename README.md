# discord-ash
Welcome, this is a WIP side project that I started on my spare time during school with the recent interest and hype surrounding ChatGPT. 

This project is a discord bot uses OpenAI's language models through their API so that Discord users can communicate with OpenAI's language models via text channels in discord. Originally meant to be a voice chat bot, I decided to make it a text chat bot instead due to lack of discord API support in audio listening. Voice functionality will be done in a different project separate from this one.

Branches:
  main - Python bot, interacts via text channels. 
  voice-js-conversion - Bot rewritten in JS to interact via voice channels.

Update 05/17/2023: Currently working on converting this bot over to javascript to utilize the discord.js libraries so that the bot will be able to interact via voice chat.
Update 05/21/2023: JS bot has the ability to interact over voice.
