# discord-ash
Welcome, this is a side project that I started on my spare time during school with the recent interest and hype surrounding ChatGPT. 

This project is a discord bot uses OpenAI's language models through their API so that Discord users can communicate with OpenAI's language models via text channels in discord. Originally meant to be a voice chat bot, I decided to make it a text chat bot instead due to lack of discord API support in audio listening. Voice functionality will be done in a different project separate from this one.

Update 05/17/2023: Currently working on converting this bot over to javascript to utilize the discord.js libraries so that the bot will be able to interact via voice chat.
